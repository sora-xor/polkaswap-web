	<h1>Polkaswap Memorandum and Terms of Services</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 16, 2021</p>
  <p class="h1">Welcome to Polkaswap!</p>
	<p>Thank you for reading this Polkaswap Memorandum and Terms of Services ("Terms"). These Terms governs the use of the <a href="https://polkaswap.io">https://polkaswap.io</a> website (the "Site") and any associated web applications, mobile applications, decentralized applications, smart contracts, or APIs as further described below (collectively, the "Application(s)" or "App(s)" and, together with the Site, the "Services"). Currently the Application accessible via the Site provides self-hosted wallet services for the Ethereum virtual machine-based blockchains and Parity Substrate-based blockchains (the "Wallet"). By using or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by this Terms as well as the Polkaswap Privacy Policy (todo: link). By creating or importing a Wallet, downloading or running our Application, or visiting our Site, you are agreeing to this Terms. This Terms is a very important document in understanding Polkaswap, Polkaswap App/Site/Services, etc. If you do not agree to this Terms, do not use or access the App/Site/Services.</p>
  <p>To make these terms easier to read:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Polka Biome Ltd. is referred to  as "Polka Biome", "Company", "we", "us" or "our".</li>
  </ul>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THIS TERMS BY USING OR ACCESSING THE APP/SITE/SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE POLKASWAP COMMUNITY THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 15 BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.</strong></p>
  <p>If you come up with any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at: <a href="https://t.me/polkaswap" target="_blank">https://t.me/polkaswap</a></p>
	<h2>Section 1: Polkaswap is a DAO</h2>
	<p>Polkaswap is a decentralized project that has no central authority. It is run as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization" target="_blank">DAO</a>. The reason for this is that Polkaswap was created by the community and exists for the community. Governance is based on voting and no software can be released or use without being deployed and enabled by the community by voting.</p>
  <h2>Section 2: PSWAP Token</h2>
  <p>The PSWAP Token is a token for rewarding liquidity providers on the Polkaswap. It was not created by any company or individual, but rather was proposed by the community and the software to create the PSWAP Token was deployed and enabled by the community, without the decision making of individual developers or contributors to the Polkaswap source code. The Company or other companies or individuals who contributed to Polkaswap were in no way involved in the deployment or initialization of the PSWAP token.</p>
  <h2>Section 3: Governance Faculties</h2>
  <p>The Polkaswap exists on the SORA network. The SORA network is a decentralized blockchain network running Parity Substrate software. Decentralized applications on the SORA network, like the Polkaswap, are developed using <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets" target="_blank">Substrate Pallets</a>, which requires that to release or update the software, a runtime upgrade of the Pallet has to be proposed and voted on by the network's users. Token voting using the SORA XOR token is used to vote to either accept or reject all Pallet releases and updates. Without this voting and acceptance by the community, the software cannot be used.</p>
  <p>The Polkaswap was released on Github at <a href="https://github.com/sora-xor/" target="_blank">https://github.com/sora-xor/</a> and then anonymous and unknown members of the community booted up the network, initializing the Pallets to the SORA network for decentralized voting. The Polkaswap app was then initialized as part of the network start, but there was no bridge. Then the decentralized SORA council, of whom a supermajority were not members of the Company or other companies or individuals that contributed to the SORA network and Polkaswap source code, voted by supermajority to enable a code update to enable a bridge to the Ethereum network. The Ethereum bridge software was put on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/sora-xor/" target="_blank">https://github.com/sora-xor/</a> and was not deployed onto Ethereum by the core team. Instead, an anonymous and unknown member or members of the community deployed the smart contract for the bridge onto the Ethereum network. The Company or other companies or individuals who contributed to Polkaswap were in no way involved in the deployment or initialization of the SORA network, Polkaswap App/Site/Service, or the PSWAP token.</p>
  <p>Because Polkaswap is a DAO, anyone can at any time propose updates to the Polkaswap runtime or software Pallets and call for a vote by the SORA community. There is no way for the Company or other companies or individuals who contribute to Polkaswap to stop proposals from being made and no way to stop deployment and use of the Pallets if accepted by the community via on-chain voting.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that no single company, entity, or individual has enough SORA XOR tokens to control voting results.</p>
  <h2>Section 4: Voting Procedure</h2>
  <p>Voting on Pallet releases or updates requires a SORA network runtime upgrade. Voting is done via the <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/pallet-democracy" target="_blank">Democracy Pallet</a> for Substrate. Voters temporarily lock up their XOR tokens to vote AYE or NAY on Pallet releases and upgrades.</p>
  <h2>Section 5: Fees and Rewards</h2>
  <p>Polkaswap uses the PSWAP token, which was created by the community, to reward liquidity providers. All aspects of the PSWAP token, reward structure, and fee structure for Polkaswap were decided by the community and can be updated by the community at any time and by anyone, using Pallet upgrades and governance to deploy them.</p>
  <p><strong>Swap fee.</strong> The swap fee is 0.3% of the non-XOR amount of each swap. All swaps go through XOR pairs.</p>
  <p><strong>Blockchain fees.</strong> To use the Services/Site/App, Users agree to bear all charges such as network transaction fees on the SORA network and gas fees on the Ethereum network and other applicable networks. You specifically acknowledge and agree that the Company, Polkaswap, and all the companies and individuals who may have contributed to Polkaswap have no control over: a) any SORA network, Ethereum network, or other transactions; b) the calculation or method of payment for any network fees; or c) actual payments of network fees. You must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of XOR stored on your SORA network address, ETH stored on your Ethereum network address, and any other applicable fee tokens stored on whatever applicable network addresses, in order to pay fees and interact with the applicable blockchain networks on your own.</p>

  <h2>Section 14: Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
  <p>A THIRD PARTY ARBITRATOR WILL HELP US RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WE MIGHT HAVE. THIS MEANS THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE SOLVED OUTSIDE OF CLASS-ACTION LITIGATION. HOPEFULLY, DISPUTES WILL NEVER BEN AN ISSUE, BUT YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY FOR DETAILS ON HOW IT WORKS.</p>
  <p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap: (a) waive the right to have any and all disputes or claims arising from these Terms, your use or access to the App/Site/Services or any other disputes with the Company, as well as you and the Company and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap (collectively, "Disputes") resolved in a court; and (b) waive any right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as described below) through binding arbitration (i.e., the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court.</p>
  <p><strong>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions, or Representative Actions.</strong> You and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree that any dispute is personal to you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other types of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
  <p><strong>Process.</strong> You and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree that each will notify the other, in writing, of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute informally. Notice to the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap shall be provided by sending an email to a designated representative of the Polkaswap community at jihoon@tutanota.de. Your notice must include: (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific action that you are seeking. If you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap cannot resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of jihoon@tutanota.de receiving the notice, either you or the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 15, commence an arbitration proceeding. You and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Company, as well as you and Polkaswap and all individuals, entities, and companies that contributed or contribute to Polkaswap agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute).</p>
  <p><strong>Choice of Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of such jurisdiction. Any Dispute under this Terms shall be finally settled by Binding Arbitration (as defined below). Any unresolved Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Clause 10 to the extent they are consistent with it. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in London, United Kingdom, in English, in accordance with the LCIA Arbitration Rules.</p>
  <p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> As limited by these Terms and applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
  <h2>Section 15: Closing Matters</h2>
  <p><strong>Changes.</strong> We may amend any portion of this Terms at any time by posting the revised version of this Terms with an updated revision date. The changes will become effective, and shall be deemed accepted by you, the first time you use or access the App/Site/Services after the initial posting of the revised Terms and shall apply on a going-forward basis with respect to your use of the App/Site/Services including any transactions initiated after the posting date. In the event that you do not agree with any such modification, your sole and exclusive remedy is to terminate your use of the App/Site/Services.</p>
  <p><strong>Third-Party Links.</strong> The App/Site/Services (if applicable) provide links to other World Wide Web or accessible sites, applications or resources provided by third parties. Because we have no control over such sites, applications and resources, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the content and availability of such external sites, applications, or resources. We do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites, applications, or resources.</p>
  <p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Terms (and any additional terms, rules, and conditions of participation that may be posted on the Site and/or Applications) constitute the entire agreement with respect to the Services and Site and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written. In the event of a conflict between this Terms and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over these Terms to the extent of the conflict.</p>
  <p><strong>Survival.</strong> Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, all rights and obligations of the parties that by their nature are continuing will survive such termination.</p>
